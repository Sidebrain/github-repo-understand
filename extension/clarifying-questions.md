# Clarifying Questions for Twitter Thread Parsing Task

Based on the task requirements for adding Twitter thread parsing functionality to the existing Chrome extension, I need clarification on the following implementation decisions:

## Integration Strategy

1. **Extension Behavior Integration**
   - Should Twitter thread parsing replace the general HTML extraction on Twitter pages, or should both be available?
   The html should be parsed into twitter thread objects. The twitter thread objects should be sent to the backend.
   - Should the sidepanel automatically detect when we're on a Twitter thread page and show different UI?
   We dont need a different UI. We should try parsing into twitter thread object, if it succeeds we show the twitter thread object in the sidepanel. If it fails we can just say no types detected, sending html to the backend.
   - Should we have separate buttons for "Send HTML" vs "Extract Twitter Thread" or intelligent auto-detection?
   No separate buttons. We should try parsing into twitter thread object, if it succeeds we show the twitter thread object in the sidepanel. If it fails we can just say no types detected, sending html to the backend.

2. **Page Detection Logic**
   - How should we detect if we're on a Twitter thread page that supports parsing?
   Look at the url. Add a confugurable pattern to detect, I will change it to find the twitter or x specific url's. (x.com/username/status/1234567890) I may be interested in threads, saved tweets and so on. 
   - Should we support both x.com and twitter.com domains?
   Yes, we should support both x.com and twitter.com domains.
   - What should happen if someone clicks "Extract Twitter Thread" on a non-Twitter page?
   We should just say no types detected, sending html to the backend.

## User Interface & Experience

3. **Sidepanel UI Design**
   - Should we show different UI when on Twitter vs other sites?
   No, we should show the same UI for all sites.
   - Do you want progress indicators during the auto-scroll and parsing process?
   We should show a progress indicator when the auto-scroll and parsing process is happening.
   - Should we show a preview of what was extracted (number of tweets, author handle) before sending?
   We should show a preview of what was extracted (number of tweets, author handle) before sending. In fact we should show all the fields we extracted, have the user confirm and then send it to the backend. 
   - How should we handle the loading states during auto-scroll (which can take several seconds)?
   We should show a loading state when the auto-scroll and parsing process is happening.

4. **User Control & Feedback**
   - Should users be able to cancel the auto-scroll process if it's taking too long?
   Yes, if its taking too long we should have a cancel button. 
   - Do you want to show "Loaded X tweets" progress during extraction as mentioned in the task?
   Yes, we should show "Loaded X tweets" progress during extraction. It need not be exactly this. I talked about this in a different question about the UI to show when a type is extracted. This allows the user to confirm and then send it to the backend.
   - Should there be any user confirmation before auto-scrolling (since it changes the page state)?
   Yes. 

## Configuration & Customization

5. **Twitter Parsing Configuration**
   - Should the config options (include_retweets, include_replies_by_author, etc.) be:
     - Hardcoded in the extension?
     - Configurable by user in the sidepanel UI? 
     - Stored in extension storage for persistence?
     It should be configurable by the user in the sidepanel UI. Don't overcomplicate the UI, if a twitter thread is parsed succesfully then show the options, because based on that I can choose to send the comments, and other fields. 
   - What should the default values be for these config options?
   Default should be thread, comments and media. 

6. **Auto-scroll Behavior**
   - The task mentions 10-12 max passes - what should our default be?
   - Should this be configurable or fixed?
   - How should we handle very long threads that might take a long time to scroll?
   Do the best practice for this, dont know enough to take a hard stance. But get it to work. 

## Backend Integration

7. **API Endpoint & Data Format**
   - I see the API config has been changed to `/api/ingest/twitter` - is this the correct endpoint?
   Yes, thats correct. 
   - What should the request payload structure look like? Should it match the example in the task:
     ```json
     {
       "url": "current_page_url",
       "page_title": "page_title", 
       "extracted": ThreadExtract_object
     }
     ```
     Yes this looks fine. I can change the ThreadExtract object to fit the payload. 
   - Do we need authentication headers (the task mentions Bearer token)?
   No, we don't need authentication headers. 

8. **Error Handling & Fallbacks**
   - What should happen if Twitter thread parsing fails (DOM changes, no tweets found, etc.)?
   We should show a message to the user that the thread parsing failed, and show the error to the user.
   - Should we fall back to general HTML extraction if Twitter parsing fails?
   If the url is twitter or x and if parsing fails, we should show the error. Because we have an active adapter that should work and if it doesnt we should show the error. 
   - How should we handle partial failures (some tweets parsed, some failed)?
   This might happen frequenly, so if some are parsed then we should show the user the parsed tweets and the error. At that point the user can choose to still send the tweets that have been parsed. 

## Implementation Details

9. **Code Organization**
   - Should the Twitter parsing logic be in a separate content script file or integrated with the existing content script?
   Separate I think. I like modularity. 
   - Should we create separate message types for Twitter thread extraction vs general HTML extraction?
   Yes, we should create separate message types for Twitter thread extraction vs general HTML extraction.
   - Where should the TwitterAdapterConfig and related types be defined?
   I think we should define them in the twitter adapter file. 

10. **DOM Interaction & Performance**
    - The auto-scroll function modifies the page - should we try to restore the original scroll position after extraction?
    No, we should not restore the original scroll position after extraction.
    - Should we disable the extraction button during auto-scroll to prevent multiple concurrent operations?
    Yes, we should disable the extraction button during auto-scroll to prevent multiple concurrent operations.
    - Any concerns about performance impact on the user's Twitter experience?
    No, we should not have any concerns about performance impact on the user's Twitter experience.

## Testing & Validation

11. **Twitter Page Types**
    - Should we support single tweet pages, thread starter pages, or both?
    We should support both single tweet pages and threads. I think the base thing we are extracting is a tweet, a group of tweets is a thread. And a tweet can also be a comment. 
    - What about Twitter lists, search results, or user profile pages?
    For now get this to work with a thread, eventually we will suppert bookmarks page so I can pull in all my saved tweets. 
    - Should we validate that we're on a thread (multiple connected tweets) before using thread parsing?
    If no thread is found, then just parse the tweets. Because anyway a group of tweets is a thread. So we will be parsing tweets. 

12. **Edge Case Handling**
    - What should happen if the thread is protected/private?
    In this case the number of tweets will be 0.
    - How should we handle threads that are actively being updated (new replies coming in)?
    We do not need to handle this. 
    - What if the original thread author has mixed content (retweets, replies to others, original tweets)?
    Dont do anything now but later we will add ability to filter, so that only threads that have the author comments are parsed. 

## Media & Link Processing

13. **Media Handling**
    - Should we extract the full-resolution media URLs or the preview versions?
    We should extract the full-resolution media URLs.
    - Do you want to capture video thumbnails/previews?
    Yes if we can easily. 
    - Any size limits on media we should extract?
    No, we should not have any size limits on media we should extract.

14. **Link Expansion**
    - Should we always try to expand t.co links using data-expanded-url?
    No, we will add this later. 
    - What should we do if data-expanded-url is not available - store t.co links or skip them?
    We should skip them. 
    - Any domains we should specifically include/exclude from link extraction?
    

## Development Preferences

15. **Error Logging & Debugging**
    - Should we add console logging for debugging Twitter parsing issues?
    Yes, we should add console logging for debugging Twitter parsing issues.
    - Do you want detailed error messages for different failure modes?
    Yes, we should have detailed error messages for different failure modes.
    - Should we capture and send parsing statistics (tweets found, media extracted, etc.)?
    Yes, we should capture and send parsing statistics (tweets found, media extracted, etc.).
