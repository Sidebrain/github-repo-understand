# Future Improvements for Chrome Extension

This document tracks features and improvements that were identified during development but deferred for later implementation.

## Twitter Thread Parsing Enhancements

### URL Pattern Support
- **Support for Twitter bookmarks page** - User wants to eventually support bookmarks page to pull in all saved tweets
- **Support for Twitter lists and search results** - Currently focusing on individual threads, but user may want to extend to other Twitter page types

### Link Processing
- **t.co Link expansion** - Implement expansion of shortened Twitter links using `data-expanded-url` when available
- **Smart link handling** - When `data-expanded-url` is not available, decide whether to store t.co links or expand them server-side

### Content Filtering & Configuration
- **Author content filtering** - Add ability to filter threads so only posts by the original thread author are parsed (excluding retweets, replies to others)
- **Advanced thread validation** - Better detection of what constitutes a "thread" vs individual tweets
- **Domain-specific link filtering** - Add configuration for including/excluding specific domains from link extraction

### Real-time & Dynamic Content
- **Live thread updates** - Handle threads that are actively being updated with new replies
- **Thread state restoration** - Option to restore original scroll position after extraction (currently not implemented)

### Media Processing
- **Video thumbnail extraction** - Capture video thumbnails/previews (marked as "if we can easily")
- **Media archiving** - Server-side media archiving instead of just storing remote URLs
- **Media size optimization** - Potential size limits or compression for extracted media

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Partial failure recovery** - Better handling of mixed success/failure scenarios when some tweets parse successfully
- **Retry mechanisms** - Automatic retry logic for failed parsing attempts
- **Graceful degradation** - More sophisticated fallback strategies when parsing fails

### Performance & User Experience  
- **Scroll position restoration** - Option to return user to original position after auto-scroll
- **Performance monitoring** - Track and optimize impact on user's Twitter browsing experience
- **Advanced progress indicators** - More detailed progress feedback during long thread extraction

### Configuration & Customization
- **Persistent user preferences** - Store user's parsing configuration choices across sessions
- **Advanced parsing options** - More granular control over what content to include/exclude
- **Custom auto-scroll parameters** - User-configurable scroll speed, max passes, timeout settings

## General Extension Improvements

### Backend Integration
- **Authentication support** - Add Bearer token authentication for API calls when needed
- **Multiple endpoint support** - Support for different backend endpoints based on content type
- **Offline queuing** - Store failed requests for retry when connection is restored

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Multiple content type detection** - Support for other social media platforms beyond Twitter
- **Advanced preview modes** - More detailed content previews before sending to backend
- **Batch operations** - Support for processing multiple pages/threads at once

### Developer Experience
- **Enhanced debugging** - More comprehensive logging and error tracking
- **Performance metrics** - Detailed statistics on parsing performance and success rates
- **Testing framework** - Automated testing for different Twitter page layouts and edge cases
